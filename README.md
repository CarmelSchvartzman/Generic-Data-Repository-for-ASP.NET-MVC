Generic Data Repository for an ASP.NET MVC Application
By Carmel Schvartzman
In this repository we hold the C# code to create a Generic Data Repository in ASP.NET MVC 4, and is the code companion for the following step-by-step Tutorial: http://themvcclub.blogspot.com/2014/06/generic-data-Repository-ASP.NET-MVC.html

This Generic Data Repository implements the Repository Pattern , and persist in the database the application data. This Repository is Generic since it supports ALL model entities in our application . All Repository C# code will work for every Entity at the data Model . This way we apply the D.R.Y. ("Don't Repeat Yourself") software paradigm , avoiding the W.E.T.("Write everything twice") approach to code . http://themvcclub.blogspot.co.il/
